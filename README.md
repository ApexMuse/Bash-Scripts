# Bash-Scripts
Various Bash Scripts

1. Write a script, getname.sh that takes a username as an argument and prints the full name of that user.
2. Write a script, getsize.sh, which takes a path as an argument and prints out the size of the file/dir at that path. Your script must do error checking.
3. Create a script called getallsizes.sh, which takes in any number of files on the command line and prints their sizes.
4. Write a script, isbiggerthan.sh, which takes a path and a size and determines if the file or directory is bigger (or equal to) the given size.
5. Update your isbiggerthan.sh script to exit with different status codes dependent on if the file is bigger than the size or if there is an error.
6. Write a script that tells a story based on user input.
